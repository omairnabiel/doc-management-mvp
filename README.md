## Getting Started

Install `node_modules` in both client and server

You can use a single command below to achieve this
$ `cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i`

To start the Backend server run `npm run dev` in `server` root. Backend runs at port 3001

To serve the Frontend app run `npm start` in `client` folder's root. The Frontend App runs on port 3000

### Tests
For testing Jest is used. Currently only tests for server exists. To run tests simply go into the 
server directory and run

$ `npm run test`
